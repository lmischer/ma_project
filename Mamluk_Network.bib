"[... T]he conception that underlies the oldest biographical dictionaries is that the history of the Islamic Community is essentially the contribution of individual men and women to the building up and transmission of its specific culture; that it is there persons (rather than the political governors) who represent or reflect the active forces in Muslim society in their respective spheres; and that their individual contributions are worthy of being recorded for future generations. Thus the earliest extant dictionary, that of Ibn Saʿd, aims firstly to commemorate all those Companions of Muḥammad [...]. Although the conception of biography broadened out later, the communal (rather than political) function of moment remains the predominant factor in the selection and treatment of personalities." S.54--5
"'History as a technical term means the communication of time, whereby the circumstances are accurately registered of the birth of transmitters and imāms, and of their death, health, intelligence, bodily state, journeys, pilgrimages, powers of memory  accuracy, and reputation for trustworthiness or otherwise... Subsidiary to this is the record of contingent events and important occurrences relating to the rise of religious communities, the origination (and sequence) of religious obligations, caliphs, viziers, raids, battles and so on.'" S.55, aber zitiert nach F. Rosenthal, Muslim Historiography 204--5, Übersetzung von Iʿlān, 67
"It follows therefore that the basic qualification for inclusion in the general run of biographical dictionaries is the contribution brought by the individual to the cultural tradition of the Muslim Community, in one or the other of its aspects, and that the selection of the biographer is determined by the particular aspects or aspect of Islamic culture to which his concern is directed. And this latter in turn is determined as a rule by his own interests or discipline." S.55
"[... T]he essential points of a biography notice for the traditional scholars: who, when where, intellectual powers, reputations. Physical facts are included, but only as being relative to the preceding, and are seldom mentioned otherwise. In keeping with this formula, the vast majority of biographical notices contain little more than shorter or longer outlines of the biographee's life (including in later works details of posts held), his teachers and pupils, traditions transmitted or books composed, and somewhat stereotyped generalities on his character, with little interest in his personality as such." S.55--56
"To the historian of Islamic civilization in its broader aspects the dictionaries are obviously of capital importance, but with certain limitations. Agriculture and the industrial arts are as thinly represented as in Who's Who, although trade and economic activities are by no means neglected in the Mamluk and later dictionaries. Given the religious and literary interests of the great majority of biographers, it is evident that they provide the fullest and most complete detail for the religious and intellectual life of the Muslim Community throughout its history, including educational and (thanks to the biographies of hukama) scientific activities. Without these works, indeed, no detailed study of Islamic culture would be possible.With the exceptions noted above, they supply also valuable data for social history and institutions, but in more sporadic and anecdotal fashion, and which have often to be combined with materials from other sources to become fully intelligible. [...] The biographical dictionaries also supply almost the sole materials for the social activities and status of women in Muslim communities." S.58},

II A Definiton of taʾrīḫ as a Technical Term
"As a technical term, taʾrīḫ is the indication of time that serves for an accurate establishment of circumstances affecting transmitters of traditions and religious leaders. It indicates the dates of their birth and death, their soundness of mind and body, their travels and pilgrimages, their accuracy and knowledge of traditions, the degree of reliability and unreliability ascribed to them, and similar matters. All of this has reference to research concerning their circumstances throughout their entire careers.Important events and occurrences that happen to take place are added to this. Such events are the appearance of a religion, the imposition of new (religious) duties, events concerning caliphs and waziirs, raids, battles, and wars, conquests of countries and their liberation from usurpers, and changes of dynasties. The term taʾrīḫ is also often extended to include the beginning of creation, the stories of the prophets, and the affairs of nations of the past as well as the cicumstances of the Resurrection and the events preceding it which will take place in the future. It may also be extended to minor matters such as the construction of mosques, schools, bridges, paved roads, and similar objects of general usefulness, celestial ones, such as the appearance of locusts and eclipses of the sun and the moon, or terrestrial ones, such as earthquakes, conflagrations, inundations, floods, droughts, pestilences, epidemics, and similar great signs and big marvels.In sum, the term taʾrīḫ signifies a branch of learning that is concerned with research regarding the occurrences which take place in time, in the intention ofestablishing theri caracter and their place in time. In fact, it is concerned with everything that was (and is) in the world."
III The Object of History
"The object of history is man and time. The problems with which history is concerned are the circumstances of man and time broken down to details within the general framework of the accidental circumstances that exist for man and in time."

While SNA is often associated with the quantitative analysis of network measures, we illustrate through our overall mapping of, and interpretation of the relations within the Denver food movement, the advantages of a qualitative approach. We bring together information from surveys, network diagrams, betweenness centrality measures, and interviews to offer an interpretive process that reveals both the structure and activist- and organization-level meanings to explain resource mobilization and collaboration. We propose that qualitative SNA allows researchers to (a) understand the context and content of network structures and (b) better interpret quantitative measures with additional qualitative data. Based on our findings, we additionally suggest that for social movement scholars, qualitative SNA offers a deeper understanding of how organizations collaborate to advance organizational and movement goals.},

In order to reveal the deep social structure, this paper analyzes the structure of social networks from three levels: microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel and reveals the origin, development, perfection, and latest achievements of complex network models. The regular graph model, P1 model, P2 model, exponential random graph model, small-world network model, and scale-free network model are introduced. In the end, the research on the social network structure is reviewed, and social support network and social discussion network are introduced, which are two important contents of social network research. At present, the research on social networks has been widely used in coauthor networks, citation networks, mobile social networks, enterprise knowledge management, and individual happiness, but there are few research studies on multilevel structure, dynamic research, complex network research, whole network research, and discussion network research. This provides space for future research on social networks.},

Most of the pre-modern examples consist of short entries collected together in so-called biographical dictionaries. To modern readers such entries seem oddly uninformative. An entry on a poet, for example, may contain extensive citations of his or her verses, but practically nothing about his life. An entry on a jurist, similarly, will list his teachers and students, his works and his date of death; but it will not report his reasons for embarking upon the study of the law, or attempt to account for his professional successes and failures by referring to his quirks of personality. Because of these differences, some modern scholars refer to entries in collective works as ‘prosopography’, reserving the term ‘biography’ only for stand-alone works devoted to a single subject. Yet even the biographies proper display little interest in how the subject ‘came to be who he was’. His character is tacitly assumed to be fixed, and the succession of anecdotes merely displays it from different points of view.},

So, what if we try to identify such texts computationally?! Not only will this help us to find all relevant titles in the sea of text—without overlooking or missing anything!—we, arguably, can get an insight into the chronological coverage of each of those titles, the chronological focus of individual historians, the chronological coverage of the entire collection of historical texts, and identify texts that focus on particular periods. The blogpost begins with an overview of several digital collections and then explains the methodology of the experiment. Appendices offer one to explore the chronological coverage of about 1,000 individual texts as well as the coverage of particular periods (here, hijri centuries—i.e., which texts focus on particular periods).},

The China Biographical Database (CBDB) is an important project that tackles this vast biographical material with digital technologies. With both online and offline versions, CBDB is meant to be useful for statistical, social network, and spatial analysis, as well as serving as biographical reference. Through the wide range of data it collects through mining historical texts and reference sources, CBDB offers multiple ways to examine the lives of past groups and individuals in Chinese history. The use of CBDB data for prosopographical and other types of analysis has generated important work that interprets Chinese history in new ways, and has also fostered new forms of digital humanities collaborations. This article introduces the history of the CBDB project and its methods for populating its biographical data. It also presents the ways that historians and other scholars could utilize its data for research and teaching.},

	annote = {"Die wirklich charakteristische Form islamischer Geschichtsschreibung in Arabisch ist jedoch nicht die Chronistik, die in den unterschiedlichsten Weltkulturen eine bedeutende Rolle spielte. Es ist vielmehr das Genre des biographischen Lexikons, das in seinen vielfältigen Ausprägungen als nahezu einzigartig für den islamisch geprägten Kulturraum gelten kann. Biographische Lexika, eine Art vormodernes Who-is-Who, wurden seit der islamischen Frühzeit verfasst und dienten anfänglich zunächst als Hilfsmittel in der Hadith-Wissenschaft, das [sic!] es erlaubte, die Zuverlässigkeit von Überlieferern einzuschätzen. Ibn Saʿds (st. 845) Kitāb aṭ-Ṭabaqāt al-kabīr ({\textgreater}{\textgreater}Das große Buch der Generationen{\textless}{\textless}) ist ein typisches Beispiel für ein solches Werk, das die Biographien in erster Linie nach Klassen (ṭabaqāt) oder Generationen organisiert." S.340
"Neure Erklärungsansätze betonen jedoch zustzliche Faktoren, die zur Popularität des Genres beitrugen. Einerseits wird hervorgehoben, dass die biographischen Lexika ein Medium waren, in denen Gelehrte eine Alternativgeschichte zur Chronistik entwickelten, insbesondere da die Chronisten häufig unter der Patronage der politischen Eliten tätig waren." S.341
"Die Produktion von Wissen über die Geschichte hat generell auch eine legitimatorische Funktion; die islamische Historiographie ist in dieser Hinsicht keine Ausnahme. Vormoderne Historiker wurden häufig an den Höfen protegiert, und viele Werke können als Lobreden auf die jeweilige Dynastie oder den jeweiligen Herrscher verstanden werden. Deutlich wurde dies zum Beispiel in den Schriften, die unter den mongolischen Herrschern Persiens im 13. und 14. Jahrhundert verfasst wurden, und in denen Autoren mit unterschiedlichen Strategien versuchten, die neue Dynastie als gerecht und islamkonform zu legitimieren. Jedoch standen nicht alle vormodernen Historiker unter der Patronage der politischen oder militärischen Eliten, sondern es gibt zahlreiche Beispiele von Autoren, die historiographische Werke nutzten, um die Herrscher ihrer Zeit zu kritisieren."

Led by researchers at the Aga Khan University, Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations (AKU-ISMC), University of Vienna (UV), Leipzig University (LU), and the Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland (College Park) and an interdisciplinary advisory board of leading digital humanists and Islamic, Persian, and Arabic studies scholars, {\textless}strong{\textgreater}OpenITI{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} aims to provide the essential textual infrastructure in Arabic, Persian and other Islamicate languages for new forms of textual analysis and digital scholarship. In the process, OpenITI will enable new synergies between Digital Humanities and the inter-related Islamicate fields of Islamic, Persian, and Arabic Studies. In addition to support from the researchers\&rsquo; home institutions, it is supported by funding from the {\textless}a href="https://erc.europa.eu/"{\textgreater}European Research Council{\textless}/a{\textgreater} under the European Union\&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, awarded to the {\textless}a href="http://kitab-project.org/"{\textgreater}KITAB{\textless}/a{\textgreater} project (Grant Agreement No. 772989, PI Sarah Bowen Savant) and the {\textless}a href="https://www.qnl.qa/en"{\textgreater}Qatar National Library{\textless}/a{\textgreater}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}Currently, {\textless}strong{\textgreater}OpenITI{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} contains almost exclusively Arabic texts, which were first assembled into a corpus within the {\textless}strong{\textgreater}OpenArabic{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} project, developed first at Tufts University (at {\textless}em{\textgreater}The Perseus Project{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, 2013\&ndash;2015) and then at Leipzig University (at the Alexander von Humboldt Chair for Digital Humanities, 2015\&ndash;2017)\&mdash;in both cases with the support and under the patronage of Prof. Gregory Crane. The much more limited number of Persian texts were compiled during 2015\&ndash;2016 in the Persian Digital Library (PDL) pilot (see {\textless}a href="https://persdigumd.github.io/PDL/"{\textgreater}Persian Digital Library by PersDigUMD{\textless}/a{\textgreater}) at Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland.
